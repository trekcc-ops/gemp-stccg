			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				GEMP is a general-purpose game engine focused on trading card games. There are currently only two public instances of GEMP, one for the Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game, and another <a href="https://gemp.starwarsccg.org/gemp-swccg/">for the Star Wars CCG here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				GEMP was originally built to emulate Legend of the Five Rings, which is where the name comes from. <i>Gempukku</i>, meaning a coming-of-age ceremony in Japanese, was intended to mirror the famous Apprentice platform for Magic: the Gathering.
			</p>
			<p>
				MarcinS was the original creator, who started up the project in August 2011.  It was soon after released in beta, and soon overtook other digital platforms as the premier experience for the Lord of the Rings TCG.  
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2021, the <a href="https://lotrtcgpc.net/">Player's Council</a> took over maintenance of GEMP and soon afterward took over operation as it was migrated to PC servers, where it runs to this day.  Ketura is the current head maintainer.
			</p>
			<p> 
				GEMP is written with a Java and MySQL back-end and a frameworkless Javascript on the front. It runs in a single Docker container (tho in the future we hope to expand that to multiple parallel containers). <a href="https://github.com/PlayersCouncil/gemp-lotr">You can find the code on GitHub here.</a> 
			</p>
