			<p>GEMP-Lotr is an automatic game client for the Lord of the Rings Tradable Card Game. Below you will
				find basic information about using it.</p>

			<ol>
				<li><b>The Game Hall</b><br/>
					A place where everything starts. When you log in, you automatically enter Game Hall.
					Same thing happens when you win/lose game. Basically you can communicate here with
					other players, create decks, create and join games, etc.
				</li>

				<li><b>Building The Deck</b><br/>
					Making a deck is very easy. In the Game Hall you will find "Deck Builder" button. Simply click it and
					the deck builder will open. At the very top of the screen you will see buttons and other controls that allow you
					to manage your deck(s). You can create a new deck, save or rename currently edited one, or open an existing
					deck.<br/>
					The rest of the screen is divided into three parts. In the left one, you can choose Ring
					Bearer, The One Ring and Sites. To the right side you can find cards which could be added to your deck. Middle
					part is what actually your deck consists of.<br/>
					The right hand side allows you to filter the available cards by various criteria - set, name, affiliation, etc.
					You can select multiple criteria and all cards matching these will be displayed below. If there is more cards
					matching that could be displayed at one time, a next (and previous) page button above will allow you to browse
					other pages. Between the next and previous button you will find slider that allows to adjust the number of cards
					displayed on each page.<br/>
					The displayed card size makes it very difficult to read the card text, therefore you can zoom in on the card by
					pressing Shift+click on the card. The same option is available without any keyboard interaction by dragging the
					card
					in the "up" direction (press left mouse button on the card then without releasing the mouse button move your
					mouse up/forward,
					then release the mouse button). Once you're done with viewing the zoomed card, just click anywhere on the
					screen.<br/>
					Once you find a card you wish to add to your deck, just left-click it to move the card to your deck - in the
					center part of
					the screen. If you wish to remove a card from your deck, just left-click it.<br/>
					Underneath the deck you will find information about the deck you're building/viewing - number of shadow and free
					people cards
					and if the deck is valid in supported formats. If the deck is not valid in some format, the information why it's
					not valid is available.
				</li>

				<li><b>Setting up game</b><br/>
					Once you have created the deck, you can start playing. You can create a new game by clicking on Create Table
					or join an existing table by clicking on Join Table. Each table displays the format the player wants to play,
					also when you create a table you have to select the format you wish to play from the first drop-down. When you
					create
					or join an existing table, you have to choose your deck from the second drop-down.<br/>
					Once there are two people at the table (one created the table, and one joined it) the game starts. Once the game
					starts other people might go over and view your game by clicking on Watch Game button.
				</li>

				<li><b>Playing game</b><br/>
					<!-- TODO: LotR code had instructions for how to use the game interface here -->
				</li>

				<li><b>Card stats</b><br/>
					Each character in game displays its current (or from time when it was last active) strength, vitality and the
					third stat (site number or resistance).
					If a character with base strength of 6 bears a weapon that gives +2 strength, the character will display 8 in
					its
					strength box. Please keep in mind that the weapon attached to it will also display the +2 bonus on it, but it
					should
					not be further added to the character strength, as the bonus is already applied. The same goes for every other
					bonus/penalty in the game and each stat.
				</li>

				<li><b>Player stats</b><br/>
					Next to the Adventure Path in game you can see each player name. To the right of the name you can find
					"chess-clock" for that player.
					This time measures time it took for that player to make decisions in game (like in chess). If the time for the
					player runs out, that
					player automatically concedes the game (loses). Directly below the player name you will see 3 icons with
					numbers, these represent: deck size,
					hand size and number of threats that player has. Next to them, you will see an extra button with a plus (+)
					sign, that allows you
					to get extra data about that player's discard pile and dead pile sizes.<br/>
					You can browse your own or opponent's dead pile by clicking on the icon. You can do the same with your discard
					pile (but not your opponent's).
				</li>

				<li><b>Skirmish</b><br/>
					As a vital part of the game, skirmish at first may look complicated. However, when you get
					used to Gemp interface you will see its fast and user-friendly. For the beginners, few words
					on how it works.<br/>
					First you need to assign minions to companions. Click on the minion, then the companion
					you wish to fight him (eligible companions will be highlighted). Assigned minions and
					companions will appear to the right side of the game table. When you finish assigning, click
					Done. Before you do it, think if it is your final decision, because you won’t be able to assign
					them differently afterward.<br/>
					Next step is skirmish. Click on the character which you want to fight first. When that skirmish
					is complete, select another one and so on. Skirmish events, special abilities, etc. which are
					playable will be highlighted during every fight. If you don’t want to play any, click Pass.
					After all skirmishes are resolved (including fierce ones) game will proceed to next stage (Regroup or Assignment
					if there are any Fierce minions);)
				</li>

				<li><b>The Iron rule</b><br/>
					There is no rolling back, simple as that. You can’t undo an action that already happen, even if
					opponent will agree. If you played cards you didn’t want to, assigned wrong or didn’t trigger
					optional action it’s done and can’t be reversed. If you do mistakes like that often, you might consider
					unchecking
					the "Auto-accept after selecting action or card" checkbox in Settings tab.
				</li>

				<li><b>Useful Stuff</b><br/>
					On the upper part of the game hall, you will find many tabs with useful information. While it's
					not obligated, I recommend reading it.
				</li>
