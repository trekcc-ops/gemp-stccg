	<p>The <a href="https://lotrtcgpc.net">Player's Council</a> is dedicated to breathing life into this old game, both through errata to old cards and the introduction of brand-new ones. Although we spend weeks or months debating the finer points of card balancing, there is no argument as powerful as the result of dedicated playtesting.</p>
